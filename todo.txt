# Things to do in emailattach.py

x Make it conform to SMTP standards (currently attachments are an "alternate") (done)
x TLS (done)

- enable multiple attachments (may be tricky, probably doable with argparse)

- make able to send multiple emails, also argparse
- the changes above require a change to when the connection is opened, must be moved up

- add a function that does mx lookups so it can send without an explicit MTA declared
